## ‚úÖ Features

- **Constrained random stimulus**: Tests FIFO under various read/write scenarios  
- **Functional coverage**: Monitors FIFO flags and data operations  
- **Scoreboard-based checking**: Compares DUT behavior against a reference model  
- **Assertions**: Checks for underflow, overflow, and correct flag behavior

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- QuestaSim or VCS  
- SystemVerilog & UVM support  

### How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sara2mahmoud/UVM-Based-FIFO-Verification-Environment.git
   cd UVM-Based-FIFO-Verification-Environment
   ```
2. Run the simulation:
   ```tcl
   vsim -c -do "do test/run.do"
   ```
3. View coverage and waveform results.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Verification Flow

1. **Compile** DUT and testbench components, including interface, driver, monitor, and agent.
2. **Run** randomized tests that cover various FIFO scenarios (write-only, read-only, simultaneous).
3. **Check** results via scoreboard and assertions.
4. **Report** coverage and any functional errors.

---

## üìä Coverage & Reports

- **Functional coverage**: Tracks FIFO flags (`full`, `empty`, `almost_full`, `almost_empty`) and underflow/overflow events.  
- **Scoreboard** logs pass/fail for every transaction.

## üìù Customization

To adapt for different FIFOs:

- Update DUT instantiation in `run.do`  
- Tune coverage models in `coverage.sv`  
- Add new sequences to `env/sequence/` folder

---
