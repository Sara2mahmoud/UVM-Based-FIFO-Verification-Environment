# UVM-Based FIFO Verification Environment
## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a complete Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench developed to verify a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) hardware design. The verification environment is designed in SystemVerilog and structured according to UVM best practices to ensure scalability, reusability, and thorough functional coverage.

The core purpose of this environment is to validate that the FIFO module correctly handles various input and output scenarios‚Äîincluding simultaneous read/write operations, corner cases, and protocol compliance‚Äîthrough both randomized and directed test sequences.

The verification flow integrates the following key components:

* **Top-level Integration**: The DUT (FIFO) is connected to the UVM testbench through a dedicated interface, allowing seamless interaction between the design and verification components.
* **Configuration Layer**: A centralized configuration package manages virtual interface sharing and parameter setup to ensure consistent access across all verification modules.
* **Driver and Sequences**: The `FIFO_driver` applies stimulus to the DUT based on transaction-level inputs defined in the sequence layer. These sequences simulate reset, write, read, and mixed operational modes to evaluate design behavior under varying conditions.
* **Monitor and Coverage**: The `FIFO_monitor` passively captures DUT signal activity, translating it into transaction objects used for coverage and analysis. The `FIFO_coverage` component defines coverage points to verify that all meaningful functional scenarios are exercised.
* **Scoreboarding and Checking**: The `FIFO_scoreboard` compares monitored outputs against expected results derived from a reference model. It logs successes and mismatches, facilitating debug and functional verification.
* **Assertions**: Embedded SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) verify protocol-level properties during simulation, helping to catch violations like underflow, overflow, or illegal transitions.
* **Agent and Environment**: The `FIFO_agent` encapsulates the driver, monitor, and sequencer to promote modularity. The `FIFO_env` coordinates all agents, coverage collectors, and the scoreboard to manage the simulation flow.
* **Test Control**: The `FIFO_test` class initializes and configures the environment, runs selected sequences, and reports simulation results including functional coverage and pass/fail metrics.

This structured and layered approach ensures that the FIFO module is verified thoroughly in a reusable, scalable, and maintainable way. The testbench is suitable for both simulation and coverage-driven verification environments and provides a strong foundation for extending to more complex memory-based designs.
